The most widespread epidemic of Ebola virus disease (commonly known as "Ebola") in history is currently ongoing in several West African
countries. \cite{url1,url2} It has caused significant mortality, with reported case fatality rates of up to 71\% \cite{url3}  and specifically 57-59\% among hospitalized patients.[ "Ebola Situation report". Ebola data and statistics. World Health Organization. 12 January 2015. Retrieved 28 January 2015.] Ebola virus disease was first described in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa; this is the 26th outbreak and the first to occur in West Africa. It began in Guinea in December 2013 and then spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone.[ WHO Ebola Response Team (23 September 2014). "Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa — The First 9 Months of the Epidemic and Forward Projections"] A small outbreak of twenty cases occurred in Nigeria and one case occurred in Senegal, both now declared disease-free.[ "EBOLA RESPONSE ROADMAP SITUATION REPORT UPDATE". World Health organization. 7 November 2014. Retrieved 7 November 2014.] Several cases were reported in Mali,[ "UPDATE 1-Mali confirms new case of Ebola, locks down Bamako clinic". Retrieved 15 November 2014.] but this outbreak has also been declared over,[ "EBOLA SITUATION REPORT- 18 January 2015". World Health organization. 21 January 2015. Retrieved 22 January 2015.] and an isolated case has been reported in the United Kingdom.[ "Ebola response roadmap - Situation report - 31 December 2014". World Health organization. 31 December 2014. Retrieved 1 January 2015.] Imported cases in the United States and Spain have led to secondary infections of medical workers but have not spread further.[ "Una enfermera que atendió al misionero fallecido García Viejo, contagiada de ébola" (in Spanish).

Retrieved 15 October 2014.] As of 3 February 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) and respective governments have reported a total of 22,560 suspected cases and 9,019 deaths,[ "Ebola data and statistics - Latest available situation summary, 6 February 2015".

Since the world medical association has announced that their new medication could stop Ebola and cure patients whose disease is not advanced, we see the light of hope to eradicate Ebola. Our objective is to build a realistic, sensible, and useful model to optimize the eradication of Ebola, or at least its current strain.
In our model, we consider not only the spread of the disease, the quantity of the medicine needed, possible feasible delivery systems, locations of delivery, speed of manufacturing of the vaccine or drug, but also any other critical factors(such as the optimal vaccine distribution approach etc.) as part of the model.
To establish this complicated model, we will proceed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Based on the SIQR model and utilizing ordinary differential equation method, we calculate the number of susceptible people, the number of infected people, the number of the quarantined people and the number of recovered people (real time) associated with the initial statistic of related regions.
\item The daily quantity of the medicine needed can be acquired simultaneously because it corresponds to the number of infected people intensively.
\item	Utilizing Fuzzy algorithm, we can convert quantitative evaluation to qualitative evaluation considering transportation condition, the severity of epidemic and other related facets comprehensively. Hence, we could judge the locations of delivery easily after getting the qualitative, general evaluation.
\item	The speed of manufacturing of the vaccine or drug will increase from experimental, small-scale production to massive commercial production for the production rate of vaccine or drug is limited by the number of production lines.[ ’’ Ebola Vaccine Challenge: Motorbikes and Kerosene Fridges’’ http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-17/ebola-vaccine-challenge-motorbikes-and-kerosene-fridges] We estimate a curve to describe the speed of manufacturing which resembles a parabola and the limit of production capacity will be a constant in a transient period.
\item	Comprehensively considering the supply and demand of drugs, the distance between locations of delivery and each epidemic area, the priority of related areas (judging by the severity of epidemic utilizing self-organized map neutral network), we use Linear Programming to design a possible feasible delivery system which provides accurate count of drugs to where it is needed from locations of delivery, respectively.
\item	Due to the fact that the emergency vaccine distribution is vital to the quick response to urgent demand when an epidemic occurs, we explored the optimal vaccine distribution approach as so called other critical factors in the requirement of the problem.

\item	%敏感性分析
we analyze the sensitivity of our model under different speed limits. It turns out that our model is robust.
\item	We identify the strengths and weaknesses of our model. Then, we provides further discuss of our models and show some work we can do in the future.
\item	Finally, we provide an overview of our approach and give a non-technical letter for the world medical association to use in their announcement.
