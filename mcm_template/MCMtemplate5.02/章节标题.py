  \item the initial velocity and rotation of the ball,
  \item the initial velocity and rotation of the bat,
  \item the relative position and orientation of the bat and ball, and
  \item the force over time that the hitter hands applies on the handle.

\begin{itemize}
  \item the angular velocity of the bat,
  \item the velocity of the ball, and
  \item the position of impact along the bat.
\end{itemize}

The simplest model for the physics involved has the sweet spot at the
\emph{center of percussion} [Brody 1986], the impact location that minimizes discomfort

\subsection{Other Assumptions}

Although Mr. Gore has expressed concerns to some associates about
the damage a brokered convention could cause, several associates
said he was hopeful that one candidate would soon break through,
sparing the party such an outcome. He told a close friend recently
that his decision not to endorse ``feels like the right thing''
and that he remained optimistic the race ``is going to tip at some
point,'' the friend said.

 Under the above and basic assumptions, we can set out
to construct our model (show our approach in detail).

\section{Calculating and Simplifying the Model  } ``A is equivalent
to B'' Although Mr. Gore has expressed concerns to some associates
about the damage a brokered convention could cause, several
associates said he was hopeful that one candidate would soon break
through, sparing the party such an outcome. He told a close friend
recently that his decision not to endorse ``feels like the right
thing'' and that he remained optimistic the race ``is going to tip
at some point,'' the friend said.

\section{Evaluate of the Mode}

%======================================================================
\section{Strengths and weaknesses}
Like any model,the one present above has its strengths and
weaknesses. Some of the major points are presented below.

%============================模型=优点====================================
\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Applies widely}\\
This  system can be used for many types of airplanes, and it also
solves the interference during  the procedure of the boarding
airplane,as described above we can get to the  optimization
boarding time.We also know that all the service is automate.
\item \textbf{Improve the quality of the airport service}\\
Balancing the cost of the cost and the benefit, it will bring in
more convenient  for airport and passengers.It also saves many
human resources for the airline. \item \textbf{}
